# StageAwareProcessMining
This project contributes a new approach to process mining based on a notion of business process stage. Process stages are a generic type of process decomposition which is prevalent in many domains, e.g. stages in a loan application process at banks such as assess a loan application, offer \& negotiate loan packages, and settle a loan application; stages of IT incident tickets where each stage is a helpdesk line; and clinical stages in patient treatment. The approach is grounded on four original and interrelated contributions: (i) a technique for identifying business process stages from event logs called a stage decomposition; (ii) a technique for discovering process models from logs based on a stage decomposition; (iii) a technique for mining process performance from logs based on a stage decomposition; and (iv) a technique for comparing business processes based on stages and other decompositions. The approach has been evaluated with real-life event logs taken from different domains.
